~~Object-oriented programming~~
in object-oriented programming we combine a group of related 
variables and functions into a unit. We call that unit an object we refer to these variables as properties and the functions methods
Keyword!! abstraction
abstraction creates simpler interface
abstaction reduces the impacts of change
!!Keyword!! Inheritance
Inheritance helps other object inherit these properties and methods so Inheritance helps us eliminate redundant code
Keyword!! Polymorphism or "many forms"
benefits of OOP 
using encapsulation we can reduce complexity and increase reusability
using Abstraction we can reduce complexity and isolates impacts of change
using Inheritance eliminate redundant code 
using Polymorphism we can refactor ugly switch/case statements

In css the # before a name is an ID
if theres no prefix(#) it's an element

"." is the class identification IE .hello would be a class called "hello"
many things can have the same class, but only one thing can have an ID
~~everythings a div~~




ChatGPT help with what I should do to learn programming
Yes, there is a recommended path and order to learn programming, especially for beginners. Following a structured approach can help you build a 
solid foundation and progress effectively. Here's a suggested path:

1. **Start with the basics of programming logic**: Before diving into a specific programming language, it's essential to understand fundamental
 programming concepts like variables, data types, control structures (loops and conditionals), functions, and algorithms. This knowledge will be 
 applicable across different languages.

2. **Choose a beginner-friendly programming language**: Select a beginner-friendly language like Python, which has a clean and readable syntax. 
Python is widely used in various domains, including web development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence.

3. **Learn the syntax and core concepts**: Familiarize yourself with the syntax and core concepts of your chosen language. Understand how to write 
and execute simple programs, work with variables, perform operations, and use control structures. Online tutorials and courses are great resources 
for learning these basics.

4. **Expand your knowledge**: Once you grasp the basics, dive deeper into more advanced topics such as functions, arrays, strings, file I/O, and 
object-oriented programming (OOP). Understand how to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.

5. **Practice problem-solving**: Programming is all about problem-solving. Solve coding challenges and exercises to sharpen your logical thinking 
and programming skills. Online platforms like HackerRank, LeetCode, and CodeWars offer a wide range of coding problems to practice.

6. **Learn about data structures and algorithms**: Study fundamental data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. 
Understand algorithms such as sorting, searching, and recursion. This knowledge is crucial for writing efficient and optimized code.

7. **Build projects**: Apply your knowledge by working on small projects. Projects help you reinforce what you've learned and provide practical 
experience. Start with simple projects, like building a calculator or a to-do list, and gradually tackle more complex projects.

8. **Explore specialized areas**: Once you have a good grasp of the fundamentals, explore specialized areas based on your interests and career 
goals. This could include web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), mobile app development (Java, Swift), data science (Python, R), or machine 
learning (Python, TensorFlow).

9. **Continue learning and staying updated**: Programming is a constantly evolving field. Stay updated with the latest trends, technologies, and 
best practices. Follow programming blogs, read documentation, and explore new tools and frameworks.

Remember, learning programming is an ongoing journey, and continuous practice and exposure to real-world projects will help you solidify your 
skills.

Some knowledge for html from chatGpt
In HTML, `h1` through `h6` elements represent section headings. `h1` is the highest level and indicates the most important heading on the page, 
while `h6` is the lowest level and indicates the least important.

The differences between `h1` and `h2` (and the other heading levels) are as follows:

1. **Importance**: As mentioned, `h1` is considered the most important and `h6` the least. So, in terms of importance, `h1` > `h2` > `h3` > `h4` > 
`h5` > `h6`. Typically, there should only be one `h1` element on a page, representing the main heading or title of the page content.

2. **Font size**: By default, browsers display `h1` in the largest font size, and `h6` in the smallest. Each level from `h1` to `h6` is smaller 
than the previous. However, the actual size can vary between different browsers and can be overridden with CSS.

3. **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**: `h1` tags are also significant for SEO. Search engines use the text inside `h1` tags to understand what a 
page is about and index it accordingly. While `h2` through `h6` can also contribute to SEO, they're typically given less weight than `h1`.

In summary, you should use `h1` for the main title of a page or section, and use `h2` through `h6` for subheadings in decreasing order of 
importance. And remember, it's good practice to only have one `h1` element per page.
